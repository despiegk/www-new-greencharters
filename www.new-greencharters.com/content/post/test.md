### Test Charters


Discover our new BVI catamaran charter yacht. This 54’ Nautitech charter catamaran combines luxurious accommodations, high performance sailing, and leading edge green technology for the smallest carbon footprint possible. With the state of the art lithium-ion battery, LED lighting, wind generator, many solar panels, and ultra-silent high output generator, the hush of dawn can be heard even if the AC is running.

Three guest queen suites each fully air-conditioned with private bath/electric toilet/shower stall and tablet controlled TV, music and movies. There are numerous lounging areas to select from - the forward trampolines, the cockpit with hardtop cover and an electric moon roof to let in the breeze or the stars. and an enormous main salon with lots of cushy seating.

Complementing the usual array of expected watersports toys are a “go fast” jet drive dinghy with low emissions, a 14’ inflatable Smart Cat from Hobie, and a 6-person floating island - perfect for Happy Hour.

We purchase local and organic whenever possible. Our cook’s background on mega yacht charters has primed her for 5-star service, catamaran style, plus she’s happy to lively up your day with yoga. Captain Oli prides himself in setting people at ease and is an avid watersports guide or instructor.

We offer a wide variety of yacht charters, from standard sailing trips through the islands to custom trips tailored to your personal desires.

The GreenBoat 1 is now available for booking for charters in Windward Islands, Leeward Islands and Virgin Islands(BVI and USVI). Other charter destinations are available on request.
